            <h2>Long-Term NDVI Trends</h2>
            <p>Over time, the NDVI has shown a general increase, indicating more vegetation. While this is positive in some ways, it also suggests shifts in seasonal patterns. More vegetation during winter months may be a consequence of climate change, with later winter starts and earlier ends.</p>

        <section class="info">
            <h2>Seasonal and Temperature Correlations</h2>
            <p>Higher NDVI values in summer may contribute to hotter temperatures. Additionally, the distinction between pre-Landsat 8 and post-Landsat 8 data requires careful interpretation due to calibration differences.</p>

        <section class="info">
            <h2>Data Calibration and Challenges</h2>
            <p>Due to satellite updates, Landsat 8 captures NDVI data with greater precision but more erratic fluctuations. This means pre-2013 and post-2013 datasets must be treated separately. Despite this, key trends remain consistent: warm spikes grow larger, while cold spikes shrink over time.</p>

            <h2>Overall Results</h2>
            <p>So in conclusion, we are seeing an increase in vegetation during winter and summer months, an increase in temperatures in both months, and correlation between the two. This is likely caused by climate change, and is only growing over time. We can't keep waiting, and we must act now if we are to fix this disaster, or we may lose much of what we love about the Wasatch.</p>
